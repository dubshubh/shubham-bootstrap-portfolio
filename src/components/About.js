      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Shubham Dubey</strong>, a passionate and driven{" "}
        <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> and aspiring{" "}
        <strong>Data Analyst</strong> currently pursuing my MCA from Graphic Era
        Hill University, Dehradun. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer

        back-end technologies, I thrive on building scalable, user-friendly
        applications that solve real-world problems.
      </p>

        I’ve worked on a range of meaningful projects—from a{" "}
        <strong>Heart Disease Prediction System</strong> using Python and
        Machine Learning to a <strong>Car Rental System</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Online Voting Platform</strong> using the MERN stack. These
        experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my
        understanding of end-to-end software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical toolkit includes{" "}
        <strong>React.js, Node.js, MySQL, Java, Python, PHP,</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Excel</strong>. I’m also proficient in data analysis, UI/UX
        principles, and basic machine learning techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take pride in my adaptability, teamwork, and eagerness to learn new
        technologies. Whether it's front-end interfaces or back-end logic, I
        bring dedication and a user-focused mindset to everything I build.
